# physiotherapy
created a physiotherapy clinic website for our client r.d. physiotherapist .
for front end we use html css java script , bootstrap and jquery 
and in backend we use little bit php although it is just a clinical site like blog to give information to patients. so that they 
contact the doctors and schedule a meet either offline or online
